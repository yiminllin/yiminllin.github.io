I am a third-year Ph.D. student from the <a href="https://caamweb.rice.edu">Department of Computational and Applied
Mathematics</a> at Rice University advised
by <a href="https://jlchan.github.io">Prof. Jesse Chan</a>. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and
Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">University of
California, Berkeley</a>. My research focuses on high order accurate and provably stable numerical methods for fluid
dynamics. In particular, I am interested in both the theory, the applications, and the efficient implementation of entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (ESDG) methods.<br><br> 

In addition, I am mentored by <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~mmin">Dr. Misun Min</a> and <a href="https://fischerp.cs.illinois.edu">Prof. Paul Fischer</a> in <a href="https://www.anl.gov/mcs">Mathematics and Computer Science Division</a> at Argonne National Laboratory. We are working on the Spectral Element discretization of Poisson-Nernst-Planck Navier-Stokes (PNP-NS) systems and its scalable, efficient implementation in <a href="https://github.com/Nek5000/Nek5000">Nek5000</a>/<a href="https://github.com/NekCEM/NekCEM">NekCEM</a>.
