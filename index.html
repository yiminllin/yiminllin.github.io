I am a third-year Ph.D. student from the <a href="https://caamweb.rice.edu">Department of Computational and Applied
Mathematics</a> at Rice University advised
by <a href="https://jlchan.github.io">Prof. Jesse Chan</a>. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics and
Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu">University of
California, Berkeley</a>. My research focuses on high order accurate and provably stable numerical methods for fluid
dynamics. In particular, I am interested in both the theory, the applications, and the efficient implementation of entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin (ESDG) methods.
